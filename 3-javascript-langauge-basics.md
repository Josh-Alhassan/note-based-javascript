# JavaScript: Language Basics

At the core of every language is a description of how it should work at the most basic level. This description typically defines syntax, operators, data types and built-in functionality upon which complex situations can be built.

## Syntax

ECMAScript syntax borrows heavily from C and other C-like oriented languages such as Java and Perl.

### Case Sensitivity

The first concept to understand is that everything in ECMAScript is case Sensitive: variables, function names, and operators are all case-sensitive, meaning that a variable name `test` is different from a variable named `Test`.
